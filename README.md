For methylArray we have two hypotheses i: There are differentially methylated patterns between naive and act_naive  ii: There are differentially methylated patterns between rTreg and act_rTreg.    process the data similarly a: quality control,the DMRs hyper and hypo methylated, visualize the sample using mds plots (of beta-value).
